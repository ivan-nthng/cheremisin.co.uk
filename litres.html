                    <p class="description gap_1">Writers and publishers have categorically different needs from data and
                        levels of immersion in it. It turns out that working with paper documents discourages writers
                        and is not obvious and operative for publishers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description gap_2">About 98% of writers in LitRes only release one book, such writers use
                        financial data to boost their own self-esteem. It's enough for them to see a positive trends.
                        Publishers, on the other hand, analyze data in detail to find insights for new books or to time
                        the launch of advertising campaigns or book releases. But both use the same interface.</p>

                        department to figure out what data and how we could get. And after that, how to move the entire
                        document process online to lower the entry point for new and old writers and increase the detail
                        and visualization of financial reports.

                    <p class="description gap_1">Litres not only does sell books, but it is also a library service. The
                        digital library works just like a physical public library. There is a books fund, which is
                        filled with budget money. Employees and ordinary readers can buy books into the fund in LitRes
                        e-store,
                        the rights to fill the collection are configured by the administrators.
                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Problem</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">The library spent the entire budget for the quarter in the
                        first few weeks. And this problem had to be solved with a graphic interface.

                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Hypothesis</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">Every new reader receives default rights to buy books into the
                        fund. These rights are the same for all libraries and not everyone is aware of their
                        existence, which means that rich and poor libraries have the same approach to the use of budget
                        money. First we must solve the problem of individualization of rights to replenish the fund.

                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Hypothesis</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">The second problem is that library staff are mostly elderly people who
                        do not want to mess around with computers and programs, so we need to motivate them, to make
                        them think of
                        the value of this work.

                        to a new reader, but it's rights are basicly restricted by the general rules of the library.

                        their user experience. They often use background colors that are not contrasting, the font
                        is too small when the book is wide, in one word typography is a whole science to ignore it.
                        We decided to limit the reader's freedom and developed an algorithm that compensates for
                        baseline and book format depending on the scale the reader chooses and picked safe color
                        combinations so that everything is contrasty and the eyes don't get tired. I had no layouts
                        left because this reader failed miserably and caused a lot of readers hate and we just
                        cleaned up the old one.

                        in the beginning. I like to meditate in this way sometimes. In LitRes, we were building a design
                        system in Sketchapp, we had a file on a shared server, and if someone was working in it, they
                        had to somehow show the others that they couldn't access the file, so there wouldn't be a
                        version conflict. And we threw a stuffed minion toy at each other, and the whole office didn't
                        understand why the design department kept throwing the minion to each other all day long.
