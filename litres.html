              WWriters and publishers have categorically different needs when it
              comes to data and levels of immersion in it. Working with paper
              documents can discourage writers and is not efficient or practical
              for publishers.
            </p>
            <p class="description gap_2">
              Approximately 98% of writers in LitRes only publish one book.
              These writers use financial data to boost their self-esteem and
              are content with seeing positive trends. Publishers, on the other
              hand, analyze the data more comprehensively to gain insights for
              new books or to time the launch of advertising campaigns or book
              releases. However, both parties use the same interface..

              document process online to make it easier for new and old writers
              to contribute, and to improve the detail and visualization of

              the majority of funding and use the data judiciously. Simply
              observing dynamics and trends is insufficient for their needs.
              Therefore, we provided detailed charts and data exports to meet
              their requirements. However, for the remaining writers, trends and
              dynamics are the primary areas of interest.

            <p class="description gap_1">
              Litres not only sells books, but it also provides a library
              service. The digital library works just like a physical public
              library. There is a book fund, which is filled with budget money.
              Employees and ordinary readers can purchase books to add to the
              fund through the LitRes e-store. The administrators configure the
              rights to add books to the collection.
            </p>
            <p class="description gap_2">
              Libraries rely on government funding, which is provided every six
              months for their budgets. Additionally, libraries fill their book
              funds with help from their users.
            </p>
            <p class="gap_1">Problem</p>
            <p class="description gap_1">
              The library spent the entire budget for the quarter within the
              first few weeks, which posed a problem that needed to be solved
              with a graphical interface.
            </p>
            <p class="description gap_2">
              The second problem is that library staff are mostly elderly people
              who do not want to mess around with computers and programs, so we
              need to motivate them, to make them think of the value of this
              work.
            </p>
            <p class="gap_1">Hypothesis</p>
            <p class="description gap_1">
              By default, every new reader has the right to buy books for the
              fund. These rights are the same for all libraries, and not
              everyone is aware of their existence. As a result, both rich and
              poor libraries have the same approach to using budget money. To
              address this issue, we must first individualize the rights to
              replenish the fund.
            </p>

            <p class="gap_1">Solution</p>
            <p class="description gap_1">
              I struggled to find a way to effectively motivate people to pay
              attention to the individual rights settings of new users. One day,
              while working at the Fyodor Dostoyevsky Library, I observed the
              process of issuing electronic library cards. In Russian culture,
              there is a strong appreciation for power, regardless of its
              magnitude. Being in a position of authority is seen as a
              privilege. I decided to leverage this cultural trait to my
              advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="description gap_2">
              I empowered the librarian to control the future of individuals,
              creating a sense of accountability. This influence extended to the
              staff, who began editing the rights of existing users. This move
              saved the budget considerably and improved the quality of the
              library's book collection.
