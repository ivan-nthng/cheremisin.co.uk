                            The company operates as an aggregator with two main
                            types of clients: passengers and drivers. Both
                            groups have questions regarding the service. The job
                            of a customer service operator is similar to that of
                            a detective and a psychologist. Although we may not
                            always be able to solve problems faster through a
                            graphical interface, we can collect and provide the
                            necessary information to reduce the time it takes to
                            search for information and process a request.

                        <p class="description gap_2">
                            The aggregator was the second biggest in the
                            country, but their help desk software was too
                            complicated. New operators had to complete a
                            two-week training course due to the high entry-level
                            requirements. The company lost money due to poor
                            customer support quality, with an average contact
                            time of 360 seconds.

                            To better understand support operators' issues, I
                            worked as one myself. I collected data on common
                            problems and pain points and interviewed a group of
                            operators for feedback. However, support operators
                            come from diverse backgrounds, including elderly or
                            low-skilled individuals who may resist change and
                            prefer the old interfaces. As a result, about 70% of
                            the initial information I gathered was useless and
                            led me to a dead end.

                        <p class="description gap_1">
                            My research has shown that the operator's work
                            consists of three parts: communicating with the
                            client, searching for or entering information into a
                            database (for us, it is the same thing, as we
                            collect all the information), and problem-solving or
                            execution. This process can be compared to the work
                            of a detective. The goal is to examine the provided
                            information and make decisions based on it.

                            the execution component, we display the necessary
                            widgets to solve the problem. In some cases, we

                            The role of a first-line support operator is similar
                            to that of a detective. They interview witnesses and
                            suspects, sift through archives, and then take
                            action based on their findings. The widget component
                            serves as an experienced lieutenant in the archive
                            department, quickly locating relevant information
                            and sometimes even anticipating the detective's
                            needs to make their job easier.

                            Support is offered through multiple channels,
                            allowing operators to receive calls and chats.
                            Operators can switch between lines and merge calls.
                            Chats also have the ability to send promo codes,
                            media files, and show response templates.

                            The chat component needs to be both convenient and
                            unobtrusive, so as not to interfere with the basic
                            work process. To achieve this, we have begun
                            transitioning to a customizable workspace. However,
                            due to the specifics of the people we were working
                            with, we could not give them complete freedom.
                            Instead, we introduced an invisible grid in which
                            everything is located. Chat component can only be
                            moved and resized within that grid to prevent
                            accidental movements from blocking work.
