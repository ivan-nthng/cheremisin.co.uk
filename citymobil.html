                        and drivers. Both have questions about the service. The work of a customer service operator is
                        similar to a
                        detective's and a psychologist's work. We may not always be able to solve problems faster
                        through graphic interface, but we can collect and provide the necessary information to reduce
                        search time.

                    <p class="description gap_2">Drivers and passengers leave and do not return. Customer service is
                        slow and inaccurate. The existing system is not scalable and cannot be reused in other projects.

                    <p class="gap_1">Plan</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">I worked as a support operator myself in order to study all the cases
                        and collect the obvious problems, interviewed a group of operators and collected their pains
                        and wishes. It just so happens that there are very different people working as support
                        operators, many of them elderly and everything new is perceived negatively by them. They are
                        ready to fight for the bad, but familiar, there are a lot of such employees, but we also need
                        to work with them. So about 70% of the information from the operators in the initial stages
                        was useless.

                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Hypothesis</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">My analysis has shown that the work of the operator is physically in
                        three entities: communication with the client, information retrieval or entering information
                        into the database (for us it's the same, we collect all the information) and the process of
                        problem solving or exeution.
