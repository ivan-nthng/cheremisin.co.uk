                            a physical public library. There is a book fund,
                            which is filled with budget money. Employees and
                            ordinary readers can purchase books to add to the
                            fund through the LitRes e-store. The administrators
                            configure the rights to add books to the collection.

                            Libraries rely on government funding, which is
                            provided every six months for their budgets.
                            Additionally, libraries fill their book funds with
                            help from their users.

                            The library spent the entire budget for the quarter
                            within the first few weeks, which posed a problem
                            that needed to be solved with a graphical interface.

                            The second problem is that library staff are mostly
                            elderly people who do not want to mess around with
                            computers and programs, so we need to motivate them,
                            to make them think of the value of this work.

                            By default, every new reader has the right to buy
                            books for the fund. These rights are the same for
                            all libraries, and not everyone is aware of their
                            existence. As a result, both rich and poor libraries
                            have the same approach to using budget money. To
                            address this issue, we must first individualize the
                            rights to replenish the fund.

                            I struggled to find a way to effectively motivate
                            people to pay attention to the individual rights
                            settings of new users. One day, while working at the
                            Fyodor Dostoyevsky Library, I observed the process
                            of issuing electronic library cards. In Russian
                            culture, there is a strong appreciation for power,
                            regardless of its magnitude. Being in a position of
                            authority is seen as a privilege. I decided to
                            leverage this cultural trait to my advantage.

                            This influence extended to the staff, who began
                            editing the rights of existing users. This move
                            saved the budget considerably and improved the
