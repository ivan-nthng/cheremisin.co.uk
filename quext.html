                    <p class="gap_1">Approach</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">We created a dashboard with customizable widgets that can be rearranged
                        based on user preference. We also added the ability for admins to save custom layouts and share
                        them with team members. This streamlined the process of accessing and analyzing data, leading to
                        a higher interaction rate and improved interface predictability. Additionally, we reduced the
                        number of transitions required to access different sections of the dashboard, making it more
                        efficient for users.
                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Universality</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">Each component has to be universal so that it can be used by other
                        vendors and engineering teams. To achieve this, we use design tokens to describe each design
                        solution and sync every design entity with its corresponding front-end solution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="gap_1">Iteration</p>
                    <p class="description gap_1">We conducted user testing on the dashboard and received valuable
                        feedback. Based on this feedback, we made adjustments to the layout and design of the widgets to
                        improve user experience. We also added a feature that allows users to quickly filter and sort
                        data within the dashboard. These changes led to an increase in the interaction rate and a more
                        efficient workflow for users.

                        The dashboard has been well-received by users and has led to an increase in productivity and
